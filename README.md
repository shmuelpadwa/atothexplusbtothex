two variables . py will solve a^x+b^x=c for positive, even if not integer, a, b, and c.

three variable . py will do the same for a^x+b^x+c^x=d

In either case, more accurate within fewer attempts the higher the value of the final variable.

two var random . py randomizes a and b between 0.000001 and 9.999999 and c between 0.000001 and 999999.999999

data creata . py allows you to keep track of the x values and number of attempts needed to reach. Do what you want with the data.
